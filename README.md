# Cash Register System with Assembly
Welcome!
This is a simple 'cash register-like' system that I have created in assembly language, specifically x86.
Basically, the program calculates the fees that are charged to a registrant according to the selected events.
It also has the ability to check whether the registrant is a member of FSEC (Forensic Security Research Center), and if yes, the price will be halved.
